ðŸŒ± Plant & Tomato Disease Classification â€“ Deep Learning Project
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying plant and tomato leaf images to assist in early disease detection using deep learning techniques.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was built with TensorFlow/Keras to process image datasets, train models, and evaluate performance.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Preprocess plant and tomato leaf images for model input

Build and train CNN models for image classification

Evaluate model accuracy and visualize results

Provide a foundation for automated plant disease detection systems

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib, Seaborn

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Tomato Leaf Dataset: Stored in tomato_image/

Plant Leaf Dataset: Stored in plant_image/

Preprocessed using image_dataset_from_directory for batching & resizing

ðŸš€ Model Workflow
Load Dataset â€“ Images are loaded and resized to 256x256 pixels

Preprocessing â€“ Normalization, shuffling, batching

Model Building â€“ CNN layers with convolution, pooling, dropout

Training â€“ Using Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss

Evaluation & Visualization â€“ Accuracy and loss plots

ðŸ“ˆ Results
Achieved high accuracy in classification

Visualizations show clear learning patterns and good model convergence
