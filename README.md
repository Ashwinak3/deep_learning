# 🥔🍅 Potato & Tomato Disease Classification using CNN

This project uses **Deep Learning** (Convolutional Neural Networks) to
classify potato and tomato leaf images into healthy or diseased categories.
The model can assist farmers and agricultural researchers in early disease detection, helping improve crop yield and quality.

## 📌 Features
- Classifies **potato** and **tomato** leaves into multiple categories (healthy & diseased types).
- Built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for high accuracy.
- Trained on labeled plant leaf image datasets.
- Model saved for easy reuse and deployment.
- Ready for integration into a web or mobile application.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy, Pandas**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **OpenCV** (for image preprocessing)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
